Overview: This repository offers a Python implementation for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It provides a modular PDE solver, a customizable neural network architecture, and tools for data generation and visualization.

Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/PDEs-by-ANN-Solver.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Customize PDE configuration in config.py.
Train the neural network: python train.py
Visualize results: python visualize.py
Configuration: Modify parameters in config.py for PDE specifics, network architecture, and training settings.

Example: An example solving the heat equation is provided in the examples directory. Run it with python examples/solve_heat_equation.py.

Contributing: Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
